# Hack Wi-Fi
This repo contains every step to hack any Wi-Fi in your surroundings.  

**The basic requirement is having a Linux distro booted in your Machine or in a Virtual Machine.**
   - Using VM requires an external Wi-Fi network adapter that should support monitor mode. (Recommended: Alfa network adapter)
   - Using your machine doesn't require any external Wi-Fi adapter if the internal one supports monitor mode.  

**Install aircrack-ng:**  
-Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S aircrack-ng
```
-Kali:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade aircrack-ng
```
-Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
```
-Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install aircrack-ng
```
